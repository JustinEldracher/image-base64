# image-base64
Simple HTML file to batch convert local images to base64 strings.

Very simple and easy to use, simply download the accompanying html file and open it in your browser.  The base64 code for each image is wrapped in quotes and followed by a comma, which makes it easy to build an array of textual images.  Each block of base64 code is also preceded by a comment with the name of the source file.
